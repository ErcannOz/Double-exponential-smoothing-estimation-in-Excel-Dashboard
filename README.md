Forecasting Sales and Market Share for İpragaz A.Ş. | SHV Using Double Exponential Smoothing
In my recent project, I focused on the energy sector, specifically analyzing the sales and market share of İpragaz A.Ş. | SHV, a prominent company in the industry. Leveraging the Double Exponential Smoothing methodology, I developed a forecasting model that provided insights into future trends, enabling strategic planning and decision-making.

Data Collection
The data used for this analysis was sourced from the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EPDK) website, ensuring that the information was both accurate and up-to-date. This data served as the foundation for the forecasting model, allowing me to apply advanced analytics to derive meaningful predictions.

Methodology
Double Exponential Smoothing was chosen for this project due to its effectiveness in handling trends within time series data. This method allowed me to account for both the level and trend components of the sales data, ensuring that the forecasts were not only accurate but also reflective of the underlying market dynamics.

The process involved the following steps:

Data Preparation: Cleaning and organizing the raw data obtained from EPDK to ensure it was suitable for analysis.
Model Implementation: Applying the Double Exponential Smoothing technique in Excel, I iteratively adjusted the smoothing parameters to optimize the model's accuracy.
Forecasting: Generating forecasts for future sales and market share, providing a clear outlook for İpragaz A.Ş. | SHV over the upcoming periods.
Dynamic Dashboard
To enhance the usability and accessibility of the forecasting results, I transformed the data into a dynamic dashboard. This interactive tool allows stakeholders to visualize key metrics, track changes over time, and adjust parameters to see how different scenarios could impact the company's performance. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly, enabling decision-makers to quickly grasp the insights and act on them accordingly.

Conclusion
This project not only demonstrated the practical application of Double Exponential Smoothing in the energy sector but also highlighted the importance of data-driven decision-making. By combining robust statistical methods with dynamic visualization tools, I was able to deliver actionable insights that can support İpragaz A.Ş. | SHV in maintaining and growing its market position.
